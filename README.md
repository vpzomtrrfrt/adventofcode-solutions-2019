My [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) Solutions
=================================================================

I'm trying a new programming language every day this time, so most of these
won't be very idiomatic. Whether I end up finishing is yet to be seen.

Languages used:
- Day 1: Ada
- Day 2: Bash
- Day 3: Clojure
- Day 4: D
